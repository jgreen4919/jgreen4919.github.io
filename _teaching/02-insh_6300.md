This class provided a high-level introduction for students who wished to learn how to conduct and evaluate social science research at the graduate and professional level. While we introduced specific methods, we focused on general principles and perspectives of the social sciences. The goals of the class were to assess scholarly literature in the social sciences, to identify interesting research questions, to formulate strategies for answering them, to understand which qualitative or quantitative tools will best address a given theoretical question, and to know how and where to find the resources that would later help one develop further expertise.
