Political theorist Adam Przeworski succinctly described democracy as "a system in which parties lose elections." But how are elections organized, what are political parties, and what factors determine who wins and loses? How do candidates and campaigns compete for votes, and how do voters choose between them? This course addresses these questions, among others related to campaigns and elections, with a focus on the United States. It is conducted in an unstructured seminar style with a heavy emphasis on reading, in-class discussion, and written engagement with foundational and cutting-edge political science scholarship.
