I am an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at [Duke University](https://polisci.duke.edu/). I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science, with focuses in American Politics and Political Methodology, from the Ohio State University in June 2020. Before joining Duke, I was a postdoc and then research scientist in the Lazer Lab at Northeastern University's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) and a fellow at the [Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy](https://shorensteincenter.org) at the [Harvard Kennedy School](hks.harvard.edu).

My primary research agenda concerns how political elites talk about politics, democratic citizens' attitudes and behaviors, and interactions between these phenomena. My peer-reviewed work concerning public opinion and political behavior in the United States has appeared or is accepted to appear in journals such as the *American Political Science Review*, the *Journal of Politics*, the *British Journal of Political Science*, *Political Behavior*, *Public Opinion Quarterly*, *Nature*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* and *Science Advances*. 

I teach courses in U.S. politics, political behavior, and political methodology.
